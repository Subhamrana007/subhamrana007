- Practicing **DSA** consistently (arrays, strings, sliding window, recursion → trees & graphs)
- Building **small but complete projects** 

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Languages:** JavaScript, Python
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, React (learning)
- **Backend:** Flask 
- **Tools:** Git, GitHub, Linux (Ubuntu)
- **Core Skills:** Problem-solving, debugging, algorithmic thinking

---

## 📈 Current Goals
- Be consistent with **daily JS + DSA**
- Improve **code clarity and reasoning**
- Grow as a **problem-first engineer**
