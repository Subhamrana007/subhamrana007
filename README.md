# 👋 Hi, I'm Shubham

I’m a developer focused on **JavaScript, Data Structures & Algorithms**, and building real projects step by step.  
I care about fundamentals, clean logic, and getting better every day.

---

## 🧠 What I'm Working On
- Deepening **JavaScript** (core concepts, async, DOM, real-world usage)
- Practicing **DSA** consistently (arrays, strings, sliding window, recursion → trees & graphs)
- Building **small but complete projects** instead of half-finished ideas
- Exploring **AI / ML basics** with Python

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Languages:** JavaScript, Python
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, React (learning)
- **Backend:** Flask (basics)
- **Tools:** Git, GitHub, Linux (Ubuntu)
- **Core Skills:** Problem-solving, debugging, algorithmic thinking

---

## 📌 Projects
*(Actively building — more coming soon)*

- 🎵 **Music Streaming / Mood Analyzer (WIP)**  
  React + Flask app that analyzes mood and recommends music using NLP concepts

- 🤖 **AI & Algorithm Experiments**  
  Small scripts and problem-solving implementations while learning ML & DSA

> I focus on finishing projects before polishing them.

---

## 📈 Current Goals
- Be consistent with **daily JS + DSA**
- Build **resume-worthy projects**
- Improve **code clarity and reasoning**
- Grow as a **problem-first engineer**

---

## 📫 Connect
- GitHub: you’re already here 🙂
- Learning in public, one repo at a time
